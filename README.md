# WebFlowAnalyzer

WebFlowAnalyzer is a powerful and flexible web application performance monitoring system that uses Go, Prometheus, and Grafana to collect, analyze, and visualize metrics. With WebFlowAnalyzer, you can gain insights into the flow of data and traffic within your web application, identify bottlenecks and optimize performance, and ensure that your application is running smoothly and efficiently.

WebFlowAnalyzer's Go metrics exporter collects metrics such as response times, HTTP status codes, and request volumes, which are then exposed in Prometheus's exposition format. Prometheus collects these metrics and stores them in a time-series database, allowing you to query and analyze the data over time. Grafana provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing the metrics, with customizable dashboards and alerts that can help you quickly identify and respond to performance issues.

WebFlowAnalyzer is designed to be minimalistic yet powerful, with a focus on simplicity, scalability, and flexibility. It's easy to set up and maintain, and it can be easily integrated into your existing infrastructure. Whether you're a developer, a DevOps engineer, or a site reliability engineer, WebFlowAnalyzer can help you gain insights into your web application's performance and make data-driven decisions to optimize performance and improve reliability.
